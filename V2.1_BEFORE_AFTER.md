### Scalability

#### v1.0 (Current)
```
Concurrent Users: 500 max
├─ Bottleneck: File I/O on shared-state.json
├─ Latency: 500ms+ for large state changes
└─ Risk: Data corruption from simultaneous writes

Single Point of Failure:
├─ One server instance
├─ One region (Render/Railway default)
├─ One developer (knowledge silos)
└─ File system failure = data loss

Cost: $50-100/month
├─ Vercel: $20/mo
├─ Render/Railway: $30-80/mo
└─ No monitoring/error tracking
```

#### v2.1 (Future)
```
Concurrent Users: 10,000+ max
├─ PostgreSQL connection pool: 100+ connections
├─ Redis caching layer: sub-50ms reads
├─ Multi-instance backend: load balanced
└─ Latency: <100ms even under high load

Resilient Architecture:
├─ Multiple server instances (auto-scaling)
├─ Database replication (multi-region)
├─ CDN for static assets
├─ Monitoring & alerting (Sentry, DataDog)
└─ Automated backups & disaster recovery

Cost: $300-500/month
├─ Vercel: $50/mo (increased plan)
├─ Railway/Render PostgreSQL: $100-150/mo
├─ Redis cache: $50/mo
├─ Monitoring/error tracking: $50-100/mo
└─ Still <$500/month = <1% of revenue

Benefit: Can support 10,000+ enterprises
